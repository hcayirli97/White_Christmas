# White Christmas


If you have watched the Black Mirror series, you have watched the episode called **White Christmas**. I think it's one of the best episodes in the series. <br/><br/>
I'm a fan of the actor named **John Hamn** in that episode.

At the end of the episode, we see a type of punishment given to criminal people. The criminal sees other people as covered in a white veil. Inspired by this episode, I aimed to develop a deep learning model that closes the people in the images. <br/>

I developed a semantic segmentation model using **Unet** architecture.

I used the [Supervise.ly Filtered Segmentation Person Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/supervisely-filtered-segmentation-person-dataset) dataset from Kaggle to train my model.
<br/>

I used images of famous people to test the model I trained. You can see the outputs in the images below.
